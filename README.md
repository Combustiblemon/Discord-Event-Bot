An event bot made for the BRTD discord server

## Environment

To inject secrets (tokens, user ids, etc) into the application dotenv is used. To set the proper variables, copy `.example.env`, rename the copy to `.env` and fill in the environment variables. These environment variables will be read on startup and can be accessed using `process.env.ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME`.
